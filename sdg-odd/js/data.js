    element: "Benefit to Canadians",
    explanation: "The information acquired and utilized must provide a clear and easily communicated benefit to Canadians. The data must support Canada's reporting on the Sustainable Development Goals (<abbr title=\"Sustainable Development Goals\">SDGs</abbr>) by enabling the measurement of an unreported indicator or by providing more granular data for an indicator already reported.",
    criteria: "Does the information provide a clear benefit to Canadians?"
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    element: "Fairness and do no harm",
    explanation: "Data that include potentially sensitive topics require a dissemination plan to alleviate any potential harm, unfairness or risk of amplifying stereotypes and stigma on groups featured in the data. Additionally, the appropriate partners should be consulted throughout the process to discuss any potential fairness and harm issues. The data must use the appropriate terminology and categories to describe the various population groups featured.",

    id: "5",
    element: "Coherence and comparability",
    definition: "The coherence and comparability of statistical information refer to the degree to which it can be reliably combined and compared with other statistical information and over time. The use of common concepts (e.g., terminology, classification, methodology etc.) are critical to ensuring coherence and facilitate its use in Canada's reporting on the <abbr title=\"Sustainable Development Goals\">SDGs</abbr>.",
